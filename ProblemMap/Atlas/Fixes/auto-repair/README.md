# Auto Repair v1

🛠️ **Auto Repair v1** is the first formal controlled-repair layer built on top of the Atlas fix system.

This folder does **not** claim that fully autonomous repair is already solved.

What it does claim is narrower and more useful:

> the Atlas now has a clear path from  
> **route → first repair direction → repair planning → validation → rollback / escalation**

This folder exists to define that path clearly, safely, and in a way that can grow without silently breaking the current system.

---

## What Auto Repair means here

In this project, **auto repair** does **not** mean:

- an AI blindly changing prompts
- an AI guessing random fixes
- an AI claiming full root-cause closure by itself
- a magic one-shot repair engine
- unrestricted autonomous intervention

Instead, Auto Repair means:

> a structured repair layer that starts **after Atlas routing**
> and turns diagnosis into a controlled repair workflow

In practical terms, the intended flow is:

1. route the case with the Atlas  
2. identify the likely failure family and broken invariant  
3. choose the most appropriate first repair family  
4. generate a constrained repair plan  
5. validate whether the repair improved the case  
6. accept, revise, rollback, or escalate if needed

So this folder is not a replacement for the Atlas.

It is the **next layer** that depends on Atlas routing being correct first.

---

## Where this sits in the full system

The current system can be understood like this:

```text
Problem Map 3.0
→ Troubleshooting Atlas
→ Canonical Casebook
→ Atlas-to-AI Adapter
→ Fix Surface
→ Auto Repair
→ WFGY 3.0 deeper continuation
````

The key distinction is:

* **Atlas** decides where the failure belongs
* **Fix Surface** suggests the first repair direction
* **Auto Repair** turns that into a structured repair workflow
* **WFGY 3.0** remains the deeper repair and experiment grammar for harder or more structurally unresolved cases

This means Auto Repair is a **bridge layer**, not the final repair engine.

Short version:

> Atlas finds where the failure lives.
> Auto Repair decides the first controlled move.
> WFGY 3.0 continues when local repair is not enough.

## Current status of v1

📌 **Current status: first formal foundation package established**

Auto Repair v1 is no longer just a vague planning note.

At this stage, this folder already defines and includes:

* architecture
* repair action schema
* validation loop
* rollback discipline
* planner specification
* planner prompt
* repair plan schema
* semi-auto repair scope
* safe early action catalog
* tiny validation examples
* tiny rollback examples
* planner test and review notes
* tiny planner output examples
* tiny semi-auto demo spec
* tiny semi-auto demo pack
* Atlas-to-WFGY bridge
* worked escalation examples
* quickstart for WFGY deeper continuation
* integrated handoff

So v1 is still intentionally limited, but it is no longer just “future idea space.”

It is now a real structured package.

* `repair-planner-prompt-v1.md`
* `repair-plan-schema-v1.json`
* `semi-auto-repair-scope-v1.md`
* `safe-early-action-catalog-v1.md`

### C. Example and review layer

This layer makes the planner, validation, and rollback logic visible and testable.

Files include:

* `tiny-validation-examples-pack-v1.md`
* `tiny-rollback-examples-pack-v1.md`
* `planner-test-note-v1.md`
* `planner-review-checklist-v1.md`
* `tiny-planner-output-examples-pack-v1.md`

### D. Demo and bridge layer

Files include:

* `tiny-semi-auto-demo-spec-v1.md`
* `tiny-semi-auto-demo-pack-v1.md`
* `atlas-auto-repair-to-wfgy-bridge-v1.md`

## Why this folder matters

🧭 The Atlas already does something very important:

* it classifies failures
* it distinguishes neighboring failure regions
* it suggests the first repair move

But there is still a gap between:

> “this is probably an F4 failure”

and

> “here is a safe, structured, validation-aware repair workflow for that F4 failure”

This folder exists to close that gap.

It is the place where the project begins to move from:

* diagnosis only

toward:

* diagnosis plus controlled repair planning

That shift is a big deal, so it needs its own clear layer.

## Scope of Auto Repair v1

### Included in v1

✅ Auto Repair v1 currently covers:

* system positioning
* architecture explanation
* planner layer
* repair action schema direction
* validation loop direction
* rollback discipline
* semi-auto repair scope
* safe early action catalog
* tiny example packs
* tiny demo packs
* Atlas-to-WFGY bridge logic
* worked escalation examples
* quickstart continuation guidance

### Not included in v1

⏳ Auto Repair v1 does **not** yet include:

* full executable repair engine
* broad autonomous patch generation
* broad automated verification across all families
* full closed-loop autonomous repair
* aggressive high-risk intervention for F6-heavy regions
* benchmark-scale repair orchestration
* production-grade executor logic
* notebook-grade or live execution for all demo paths

So this README describes a **real v1 package**, but not a final autonomous repair engine.

## Best early candidate families

For early Auto Repair development, the safest and strongest starting regions remain:

### F1 · Grounding & Evidence Integrity

Good early targets:

* re-grounding
* evidence filtering
* anchor re-check
* chunk-to-target correction

Why it is a good first target:

* the repair surface is relatively concrete
* before / after comparison is easier
* misrepair is easier to detect

### F4 · Execution & Contract Integrity

Good early targets:

* readiness gate insertion
* ordering validation
* block-until-ready logic
* closure-path hardening

Why it is a good first target:

* many failures are workflow-structural
* repair actions are often explicit
* success conditions are often clear

### F7 · Representation & Localization Integrity

Good early targets:

* schema tightening
* JSON shell correction
* descriptor tightening
* container validation

Why it is a good first target:

* structure is often visible
* repair outcomes are inspectable
* replay demos are easier to build

---

## Higher-risk regions

Some areas should still be treated much more carefully.

### F5

Auto Repair can help with:

* observability uplift
* trace insertion
* logging suggestions

But there is risk in mistaking visibility improvement for full repair.

### F3

Some continuity scaffolds may be possible, but deeper continuity repair can get complicated quickly.

### F6

🚫 This is **not** a good place for aggressive early auto repair.

Boundary-heavy cases often require:

* judgment
* intervention restraint
* explicit escalation
* stronger human review

Early F6 work should lean toward:

* planner mode
* warning mode
* stabilization suggestions

not broad automatic execution.

## Relationship to WFGY 3.0

This is one of the most important parts of the folder.

Auto Repair should not be misread as replacing WFGY 3.0.

The correct relationship is:

* **Atlas** handles diagnosis
* **Auto Repair** handles the first controlled repair move
* **WFGY 3.0** handles deeper continuation when local repair is insufficient

This usually happens when:

* local repair helps only partially
* the deeper effective-layer encoding remains weak
* stronger observables are needed
* mismatch logic remains too shallow
* the case keeps returning `revise`, `rollback`, or `escalate`
* local fixes improve symptoms without stabilizing structure

### Official WFGY 3.0 TXT

Use this official TXT as the deeper continuation asset:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt
```

Shortest practical reading:

> Start with Atlas.
> Try the first controlled Auto Repair move.
> If local repair is not enough, continue with WFGY 3.0.

## Safety boundary

⚠️ Auto Repair must stay disciplined.

The following rules remain non-negotiable:

1. **Route first, repair second**
   Auto Repair should never skip Atlas routing.

2. **First controlled move only**
   Early versions should focus on the first repair move, not pretend to solve everything.

3. **Validation is mandatory**
   A repair proposal without a validation path is incomplete.

4. **Rollback must exist**
   If a repair makes the system worse, the workflow must support backing out.

5. **Not all families are equally safe for early semi-auto repair**
   F1, F4, and F7 remain the best early targets.

6. **No silent WFGY escalation**
   If a case escalates into WFGY 3.0, that transition should be explicit and justified.

---

## What future work should not do

Future work should **not** do the following:

* silently rewrite the core workflow
* overclaim autonomous repair
* treat tiny demos as proof of full repair power
* push F6-heavy intervention too early
* blur Atlas, Auto Repair, and WFGY 3.0 into one vague layer

The layered relationship is one of the most valuable parts of the whole design.

---

## What future work should do

Recommended next directions include:

* thicken the action library
* add more worked escalation examples
* improve WFGY continuation guidance
* grow from tiny markdown demos toward replay / JSON / notebook demos
* define a future constrained executor boundary without pretending it already exists

---

## Official v1 interpretation

The correct interpretation of Auto Repair v1 is:

> the first formal controlled-repair package for Atlas-based repair has now been established,
> but broad autonomous repair execution remains future work.

This wording is strong, honest, and safe.

---

## One-line status

**Auto Repair v1 is now established as the first controlled repair layer between Atlas diagnosis and deeper WFGY 3.0 continuation.**
