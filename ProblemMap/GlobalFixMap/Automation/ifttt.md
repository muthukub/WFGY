Use this when your automation is built on **IFTTT** (Webhooks, Google Sheets, Gmail, Slack, Calendar). If flows “work” but answers are still wrong, citations are off, or behavior differs between applets and direct API tests, anchor your diagnosis here.

**Acceptance targets**
- ΔS(question, retrieved) ≤ 0.45
- Coverage ≥ 0.70 to the intended section or record
- λ stays convergent across 3 paraphrases

## Minimal IFTTT pattern with WFGY checks

A compact pattern that keeps **cite-first schema**, **observable retrieval**, and **ΔS/λ** validation even when steps are split across applets.

```txt
Applet A — Trigger (Webhooks)
- Input JSON: { question, k? }

Applet B — Retrieve (Webhooks → your retriever API)
- Returns: snippets[] = { snippet_id, text, source, section_id }
- Store: a short-lived record (e.g., in Google Sheets or your API, keyed by request_id)

Applet C — Assemble + Call LLM (Webhooks → your prompt API)
SYSTEM:
  Cite lines before any explanation. Keep per-source fences.
TASK:
  Answer only from the provided context. Return citations as [snippet_id].
CONTEXT:
  <joined snippets with snippet_id + source + text>
QUESTION:
  <user question>

Applet D — WFGY Post-check (Webhooks → wfgyCheck)
- Body: { question, context, answer }
- Returns: { deltaS, lambda, coverage, notes }

Applet E — Gate and Notify
IF deltaS ≥ 0.60 OR lambda != "→"
  → send failure payload with trace table (snippet_id↔citation), ask to retry after fix
ELSE
  → deliver { answer, citations[], deltaS, lambda, coverage } to user channel
````

## IFTTT-specific gotchas

* **Sheets cell truncation** hides context length. Store only `snippet_id` and a short preview in Sheets, keep full text in your API or DB.
  See [Data Contracts](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/data-contracts.md)

* **Hidden tokenization** when composing prompts in plain text fields. Always assemble prompts in your API layer to enforce the cite-first schema.
  See [Retrieval Traceability](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md)

* **Environment mismatch** between mobile and server triggers. Bootstrap checks must verify secrets, version, and index availability before the first LLM call.
  See [Pre-Deploy Collapse](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/predeploy-collapse.md)

* **Ordering hazards** when multiple applets race. Add an explicit **rerank** step after per-source ΔS ≤ 0.50, then lock order.
  See [Rerankers](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md)

* **Attachment loss** in cross-channel handoffs. Store attachment metadata and link by `request_id`, never inline large blobs into prompts.

## When to escalate

* ΔS stays ≥ 0.60 after chunking and retrieval adjustments → rebuild index with explicit metric flags and unit normalization.
  [Retrieval Playbook](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-playbook.md)

* Answers flip between device-triggered and server-triggered runs → verify version skew, secret scope, and boot ordering.
